To solve the "Predict the Winner" problem, we need to determine if Player 1 can win the game given that both players play optimally. The players take turns choosing either the first or last number in the array, and Player 1 starts the game. We should return true if Player 1 can either win or tie with Player 2; otherwise, return false.

Key Observations:
Optimal Play:

Both players are assumed to play optimally, meaning they always make the choice that maximizes their score or minimizes their loss.
Recursion and Memoization:

Since the array is reduced in size with each turn, a natural approach is to use recursion to explore the possible outcomes based on the player's choices.
To avoid recalculating results for the same subarrays, we use memoization to store previously computed results.
Game Simulation:

We can simulate the game by tracking the difference in scores between Player 1 and Player 2. The goal is to see if Player 1 can achieve a non-negative score difference by the end of the game.
When it's Player 1's turn, we add the value of the chosen number to the score difference. When it's Player 2's turn, we subtract the value of the chosen number.
Approach:
Define the Recursive Function:

Let dfs(left, right) represent the maximum score difference (Player 1's score - Player 2's score) that can be achieved for the subarray nums[left:right+1].
The function has two choices:
Choose the left element (nums[left]) and then let the opponent play optimally on the subarray nums[left+1:right].
Choose the right element (nums[right]) and then let the opponent play optimally on the subarray nums[left:right-1].
We calculate the score difference for each choice and take the maximum.
Memoization Table:

Use a 2D array memo to store the results of dfs(left, right) to avoid recomputing the values.
Base Case:

If there is only one element, dfs(left, left) returns the value of that element, as it would be added directly to the current player's score.

public class Solution {
public boolean PredictTheWinner(int[] nums) {
int n = nums.length;
Integer[][] memo = new Integer[n][n]; // Memoization table

        // Helper function to calculate the maximum score difference
        int scoreDifference = dfs(nums, 0, n - 1, memo);
        return scoreDifference >= 0;
    }

    private int dfs(int[] nums, int left, int right, Integer[][] memo) {
        if (left == right) {
            return nums[left]; // Only one element left
        }

        if (memo[left][right] != null) {
            return memo[left][right]; // Return the memoized result
        }

        // Choose the left element or the right element
        int chooseLeft = nums[left] - dfs(nums, left + 1, right, memo);
        int chooseRight = nums[right] - dfs(nums, left, right - 1, memo);

        // Take the maximum score difference that can be achieved
        memo[left][right] = Math.max(chooseLeft, chooseRight);
        return memo[left][right];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();

        // Test case 1
        int[] nums1 = {1, 5, 2};
        System.out.println(solution.PredictTheWinner(nums1)); // Output: false

        // Test case 2
        int[] nums2 = {1, 5, 233, 7};
        System.out.println(solution.PredictTheWinner(nums2)); // Output: true
    }

}
Explanation of the Code:
Memoization (memo):

A 2D array memo[left][right] is used to store the results for subarrays nums[left:right+1] to avoid recomputation.
dfs Function:

Recursively calculates the maximum score difference that can be achieved from subarray nums[left:right+1].
Two choices are considered:
Choose the leftmost element, resulting in nums[left] - dfs(left + 1, right).
Choose the rightmost element, resulting in nums[right] - dfs(left, right - 1).
Base Case Handling:

When only one element is left (left == right), it returns nums[left], as it would be added to the current player's score.
Game Outcome Check:

If the maximum score difference is non-negative, Player 1 can win or tie; otherwise, Player 2 wins.
Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity:
ùëÇ(ùëõ2)
O(n2), where
ùëõ
n is the length of the array. Each subproblem is computed once and stored in the memoization table.
Space Complexity:
ùëÇ
(
ùëõ
2
)
O(n
2
), for the memoization table.
Example Execution:
For nums = [1, 5, 2]:

Player 1 can choose 1 or 2. The optimal play results in a loss because Player 2 can always choose a number to maximize their score.
For nums = [1, 5, 233, 7]:

Player 1 can choose optimally to ensure a higher score than Player 2.
Conclusion:
The solution uses dynamic programming with memoization to efficiently calculate the optimal strategy for Player 1. The approach ensures that all subproblems are solved while avoiding redundant calculations.
